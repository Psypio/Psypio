- 👋 Hi, I’m Psypio or Josh.
- 👀 I’m interested in collaberating with other developers and teams.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Python + learning how to use a laser cutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with Sympio (my newly founded gaming platform) to make play and creation easier than ever before.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can DM me directly either on Discord (Psypio#0001) or Twitter (@DeveloperPrime).
